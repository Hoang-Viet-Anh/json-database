# JSON Database
JetBrains Academy. Project: JSON Database.

JSON database is a single file database that stores information in</br>
the form of JSON. It is a remote database, so it's usually accessed</br>
through the Internet.

In Second stage, implemented the simplest connection</br>
between one server and one client. The client should send</br>
the server a message: something along the lines of Give</br>
me a record # N, where N is an integer number. The server</br>
should reply A record # N was sent! to the client. Both the</br>
client and the server should print the received messages to</br>
the console. Note that they exchange only these texts, not</br>
actual database files.

Jar file is located by ./JSON Database/task/build/libs.
